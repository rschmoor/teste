/* Placeholder for Inter Variable Font */
/* This is a placeholder file. In production, you would:
   1. Download the actual Inter Variable font from https://rsms.me/inter/
   2. Place the .woff2 file here
   3. Or use next/font/google to load Inter automatically */

/* For now, the system will fall back to system fonts as defined in CSS */
